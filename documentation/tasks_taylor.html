    (3/25/16)
    - Created greetingCards database.
    - Created users, userCards, cardTemplates, and sentCards tables.
    - Added sequelize ORM module to project.

    - Added database connection and data model code (found in database folder)
        -- Hooked up database to server (database/db.js)
        -- Defined users table so sequelize can map the table data to JSON objects (database/models/users.js)
        -- Defined cardTemplate table (database/models/cardTemplates.js)
        -- Defined userCards table (database/models/userCards.js)
        -- Defined sentCards table (database/models/sentCards.js)

    - Updated users API to serve data from database instead of hard-coded data.
    - Updated themes API to serve data from database instead of hard-coded data.
    
    (3/30/16)
    - Renamed a few columns of some of the tables. (For example renamed the userId column 
    in the users table to just id).
    - Created themes and templateThemes relations so card templates can have multiple themes, and 
    can be filtered by theme category.
    - Renamed the former themes API to templates API since it's serving card template data, not theme data.
    - Added placeolder images to support the dummy template data we have stored in the database.
    - Updated card template pages to display thumbnails of all card templates, as well as their names and description.
